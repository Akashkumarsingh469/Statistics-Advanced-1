        "-Hypothesis testing in statistics is a systematic method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two opposing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H₀), which represents the assumption of no effect or no difference, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Ha), which represents the claim to be tested. Using sample data, statistical tests are applied to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The decision is made based on probabilities, significance levels (α), and test statistics such as the z-test, t-test, chi-square test, or ANOVA. Hypothesis testing helps researchers and analysts assess the reliability of conclusions drawn from data."
